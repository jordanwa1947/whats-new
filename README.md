# What's New?

What's new is a React App I made to practice the fundamentals of React. It displays news articles 'cards' imported from data files within the project. The menu allows you to sort these cards by category and the search bar searches through the titles of the articles and displays the matching ones. 

This is all done with React by passing information down from the App component through the props of child components. Those child components manage their state and pass actions back up as the user interacts with the page.

This application was built with `create-react-app`.
